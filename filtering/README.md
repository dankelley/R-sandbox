# Contents of this directory

* `butter01.R` as in the docs for `filter::filtfilt()`, but correct the
  comments. (Note: I sent Uwe Ligges a report on the errors in the docs.)

* `butter02.R` a test case with white-noise as input, to show 1/4-power at the
  filter cutoff frequency, etc. The code is not documented but ought to be
  clear to readers.

* `README.md` the present file.
