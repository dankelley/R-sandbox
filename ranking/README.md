* `ranking01.R` demonstration of a suggested method for processing rankings
  made by members of a committee. See
  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOxEfYG6wRg> for an explanation of the
  method, and some reasons why I prefer this method (`R$Rank` in the code) over
  an alternative scheme (called `R$RankingNew` in the code).
